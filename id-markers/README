README for id-markers

This folder contains markers for both of ARToolKitPlus' id-based marker
systems (called 'simple' and 'BCH'). One can always create new marker
images (e.g. bch with standard border width) using the tool IdPatGen.

Subfolders are arranged as following:

id-markers/bch - Contains all 4096 markers for the BCH marker system. All
                 these markers have a thin border (border width of 0.125).
                 AllBchThinMarkers.png shows all 4096 markers in one
                 large image.

id-markers/simple/std-border - All 512 simple id-based markers with
                               standard border width (value 0.250).
                               AllSimpleStdMarkers.png shows all 512
                               markers in one image.

id-markers/simple/thin-border - All 512 simple id-based markers with thin
                                border width (value 0.125).

All these markers image files are ready to use. The marker images are very
small (6x6 and 8x8 pixels) since they only contain the minimum required
number of pixels (as there is no point in saving them at a specific size).

All one has to do, is to print them at the prefered size. It is important
to turn off any kind of filtering (nearest neighbour filtering is ok of
course...) as otherwise the marker image would become blurred. Under
Windows IrfanView is a good and free tool to print images at any size.

In contrast to template based markers, it is not required or possible to
train these markers to ARToolKitPlus. Just put a printed marker in front
of the camera an it should be detected (considering the marker size,
border width and system has been setup correctly).

To use the markers with a thin border one needs to call
tracker->setBorderWidth(0.125f);

To use the markers with standard border width, no change of the default
setup is required. Yet calling tracker->setBorderWidth(0.250f); would reset
ARToolKitPlus to the correct border width for these markers.

Final note: Be sure to set marker size to 6x6 in ARToolKitPlus for any kind
of id-based markers!
